# GB Cero

It's a minimalist Retropie theme for my Gameboy Zero build (Gameboy Cero). 
This ditches the carousel for lists and maximizes the height of each entry for more comfortable viewing on small displays.
Designed for a 320x240 pixel display, but the actual viewing area is only 240x200 so this could be cropped easily.

*Notes on Use*
This theme is specifically designed for a 3.5" LCD TFT display at 320x240 resolution without removing any of the plastic on the Gameboy's DMG-01 case.
However, you will need to align the display with the window in the case properly for this theme to work out-of-box.

The better option is to crop and adjust the 5 or 6 png images required to line the menus up properly. 
The Gameboy Color background image is already designed to allow for a small pixel allowance if you only need to adjust the overlays a few pixels.
Just set a custom splash screen, turn on the Gameboy, and take a picture of the screen. 
You can probably count the pixels with your cell phone camera if you really want a perfect view.
I originally laid a 10x10 pixel grid over a blank 320x240 png to measure the viewing window.
